---

During last year's [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), I decided to make a small, achievable extension for VS Code. It was a good way to learn TypeScript, work with people on Github projects, and most importantly: have fun!

The extension is called [Light Switch](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=timrodz.lightswitch) ‚Äî It is a time based, light/dark theme switcher. When I published my first series of commits to get started, I also wrote a post about it on DEV. I was sure this would help me get traction and a small following of people that would _hopefully_ be willing to contribute in one way or another:

The post was well-received, and it got the traction I wanted. Once the rush came down, I still needed to figure out how to:

1. [Create tests](#tests).
2. [Bundle the extension](#bundling).
3. [Publish the extension](#publishing).
4. [Set up a Continuous Integration (CI) pipline](#ci).

Here's how I achieved it.

## Writing tests üìù <a name="tests"></a>

If you're writing software, writing tests is an awesome way to ensure it will work. Since I did not have much time or experience with TypeScript, I made sure to focus my tests on the theme swapping logic:

- Make sure the themes stay as day/night according to their times
- Ensure a default "fallback" theme could be chosen if there was an error

Since my logic mainly involves time, I focused on time conversions. This is an example of the tests I added:

```typescript
import * as assert from "assert";
import * as dayjs from "dayjs";
import { canSwitchToNightTheme } from "../../util/date";

suite("Date Test Suite", () => {
  test("Setting time through the extension", () => {
    assert(!canSwitchToNightTheme("17:00", "16:00"));
    assert(canSwitchToNightTheme("17:00", "17:00"));
    assert(canSwitchToNightTheme("17:00", "17:01"));
    assert(!canSwitchToNightTheme("17:00", "00:00"));
    assert(canSwitchToNightTheme("17:00", "24:00"));
    assert(canSwitchToNightTheme("17:00", "23:59"));
  });
});
```

Basic assertions, **check!**

## Bundling the extension! üöÄ <a name="bundling"></a>

I'm sure many of you have a love/hate relationship with webpack. Yes, it's great, and also painful. Luckily, Microsoft has excellent documentation on [how to bundle a VS Code extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/bundling-extension) - yay!

### Handling dependencies

```bash
1. npm uninstall vscode
2. npm i --save-dev webpack webpack-cli ts-loader vscode-test
3. npm i --save-dev @types/vscode@1.37.0
```

1. Remove the `vscode` dependency, as it has been superseded by `vscode-test` ‚Äî This will ensure your tests run on the Azure DevOps pipeline.
2. Installed the required basic dependencies
3. Added `@types/vscode@^1.37.0`. Depending on the version of your vscode engine, you will have to specify it as `@types/vscode@ENGINE_VERSION`.
4. Removed the `postinstall` script of `package.json`. It is not needed anymore.

### Creating the Webpack configuration

With this configuration, builds will be (by default) output into the `dist/` folder at the root of the project. Nothing too fancy here!

```javascript
//@ts-check

"use strict";

const path = require("path");

/**@type {import('webpack').Configuration}*/
const config = {
  target: "node",

  entry: "./src/extension.ts",
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "extension.js",
    libraryTarget: "commonjs2",
    devtoolModuleFilenameTemplate: "../[resource-path]",
  },
  devtool: "source-map",
  externals: {
    vscode: "commonjs vscode",
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: [".ts", ".js"],
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.ts$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: "ts-loader",
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
module.exports = config;
```

### Adjusting the extension configuration files

#### package.json

I added a step called `test-compile` so it can compile our source for tests (Read why on the next section)

```json
"scripts": {
  "vscode:prepublish": "webpack --mode production",
  "compile": "webpack --mode production && npm run test-compile",
  "watch": "webpack --mode development && tsc -watch -p ./",
  "test": "node ./out/test/runTest.js",
  "test-compile": "tsc -p ./",
}
```

#### launch.json

Even though the webpack build points to the `dist/` folder, tests are compiled to the `out/` folder, which means we have to compile the app (Refer to the `test-compile` command of `package.json`. Luckily, this can be specified on the `preLaunchTask`, so I made sure it ran `test-compile`.

```json
"configurations": [
  {
    "name": "Run Extension",
    ...
    "outFiles": ["${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.js"],
    "preLaunchTask": "npm: watch"
  },
  {
    "name": "Extension Tests",
    ...
    "outFiles": ["${workspaceFolder}/out/test/**/*.js"],
    "preLaunchTask": "npm: test-compile"
  }
]
```

#### .vscodeignore

Getting this one right was a bit difficult, here's why:

You have to exclude `node_modules`. The caveat: If you have a dependency (not devDependency), you will have to include it. I had `moment` as a dependency, but was able to swap it for `dayjs`, even as a devDependency. _Woosh!_

As a general rule, ignore everything that is not the source of the app (including icons/images your app uses).

```text
# folders
.vscode/**
.vscode-test/**
src
out
node_modules
**/tsconfig.json
**/tslint.json
**/*.map
**/*.ts
*.vsix

# Specific files
.gitignore
webpack.config.js
CONTRIBUTING.md
package-lock.json
.prettierrc

# Special exclusions
images
!images/icon.png
```

### Making sure it runs!

- I had to make sure my builds were compiling. By running `npm run compile` and `npm run test-compile`, they succeeded!

## Publishing the extension ‚òÅÔ∏è <a name="publishing"></a>

The only dependency I needed was a global one: `npm install -g vsce`. [vsce](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-vsce) is a CLI for managing VS Code extensions.

Interestingly, this was the easiest part. I had to create an Azure DevOps organization, and I followed every step of this [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization?view=azure-devops).

When creating the marketplace publisher, I was prompted for my Personal Access Token, which I generated following [these steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#get-a-personal-access-token).

My strategy for publishing would be:

- Publish it first using `vsce publish` so the app was live
- Set-up a Continuous Integration environment to automate the following deploys.

### Making sure it runs!

The cool thing of all this, you can install your builds locally! This is different to debugging your build directly from the **Launch** menu because it emulates the flow of downloading the build directly from the marketplace.

The command `vsce package` triggers the `vscode:prepublish` script from `package.json` configuration. A `.vsix` file will be created at the root directory. Install the extension by running `code --install-extension extension-name.vsix`. Replace `extension-name` for the file generated by `vsce package`, i.e. `light-switch-0.1.0.vsix`.

## Continuous Integration (CI) üõ† <a name="ci"></a>

Once my extension was live, I had to implement the most important part: a CI pipeline. This is a great DevOps practice, as it automates all your builds, and runs your tests on new changes - This ensures new code won't break the app before being able to merge it into the master branch.

You can have a look at my pipeline [build summary](https://dev.azure.com/timrodz/Light%20Switch/_build?definitionId=1&_a=summary).

Here are some key takeaways I learned:

- Before setting up any CI pipeline, make sure your app works locally, and that every command behaves as intended.
- You don't have to know how to use YAML files to set up a working pipeline. Microsoft offers [many templates to get started with](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-yaml).
- Azure DevOps allows you to build and deploy without having to create any artifacts/releases - This is awesome, and it saves a lot of time!

## Setup

### azure-pipelines.yml

```yml
# Builds from every branch, and tag.
trigger:
  branches:
    include: ["*"]
  tags:
    include: ["*"]

# Machines that it builds to
strategy:
  matrix:
    linux:
      imageName: "ubuntu-16.04"
    mac:
      imageName: "macos-10.13"
    windows:
      imageName: "vs2017-win2016"

# Takes in the machines specified in the strategy.
pool:
  vmImage: $(imageName)

steps:
  # Installs Node.js
  - task: NodeTool@0
    inputs:
      versionSpec: "8.x"
    displayName: "Install Node.js"

  # Installs an X virtual framebuffer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb).
  # Only required for running the VS Code in the Linux machine.
  - bash: |
      /usr/bin/Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x24 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
      echo ">>> Started xvfb"
    displayName: Start xvfb
    condition: and(succeeded(), eq(variables['Agent.OS'], 'Linux'))

  # Run yarn (Install dependencies) and run the compile script.
  # It also runs the tests and stops the pipeline if one test fails.
  - bash: |
      echo ">>> Compile vscode-test"
      yarn && yarn compile
      echo ">>> Run integration test"
      yarn && yarn compile && yarn test
    displayName: Run Tests
    env:
      DISPLAY: ":99.0"

  # Publishes the extension to the marketplace.
  - bash: |
      echo ">>> Publish"
      yarn deploy -p $(VSCODE_MARKETPLACE_TOKEN)
    displayName: Publish
    condition: and(succeeded(), startsWith(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/tags/'), eq(variables['Agent.OS'], 'Linux'))
```

And here we have it!

> The last build had an error while building with Windows, but it was able to deploy the latest changes using the Linux image. See the [build output](https://dev.azure.com/timrodz/Light%20Switch/_build/results?buildId=25&view=results).

#### Notes

A YAML configuration can run as many commands as you want. Think of every `- bash: |` entry as a set of new commands that will run in a specified batch. It can execute bash commands i.e. `ls`, `pwd`, `echo`, etc.

The last step, which publishes the extension, passes in a `$(VSCODE_MARKETPLACE_TOKEN)` variable. This is the **Personal Access Token (PAT)** we defined earlier on the [Publishing](#publishing) section. If my variable was named `secret`, then the script would run `yarn deploy -p $(secret)`.

The last build step has a condition:

```shell
and(succeeded(), startsWith(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/tags/'), eq(variables['Agent.OS'], 'Linux'))
```

This condition tells our pipeline to deploy with builds that meet the following requirements:

- The building machine's OS is Linux (In my case: Ubuntu 16.04).
- The commit has a [git tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging).
  - I solved my tagging by using [Semantic Versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning) via `npm version` command, i.e. `npm version major/minor/patch`. This is convenient because it updates the `package.json` version, and makes a commit with a tag:

## It's a wrap! üåØ

The entire process did not take long, but figuring out the CI pipeline was the most complex part by far. Thanks to Microsoft's well-written documentation, I was able to put the pieces together.
