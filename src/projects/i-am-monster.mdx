Fresh out of university, this was the first commercial project I worked on. I
joined the team as a Junior Game Programmer, and took ownerhsip of building
many of the game’s UIs. It’s also the first time I had a look at backend
development with Python, and I absolutely loved the entire process!

I took ownerhsip of many of the game's UI systems, where I worked together with the design and UX leads.
