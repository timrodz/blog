I used PlayCanvas to develop online 3D tours for clients. It is a browser-based platform that lets you build 3D experiences, including games. Here are some of the demos I can show for what I've built.

**Note**: Many of these projects have NDAs attached to them, so I can't show the full experience nor talk about most features. However, I've been cleared for showing stills and certain videos.

## Summary of what I achieved:

- Concurrent multiplayer supporting 30+ players in 1 room: movement + real-time voice chat using [Agora.io](https://www.agora.io/en/)
- 3D room development
- In-house room teleportation system
- Spotify SDK + Apple SDK integrations (music playback, playlists, etc.)
- Online servers built with [Colyseus.io](https://colyseus.io/)

**3D room development**: Using PlayCanvas' built-in editor, I would develop 3D rooms and place interactive items inside them. For example: Easter eggs, interactable objects, etc.

**Online multiplayer**: In this room there are 30+ bots connected to the same server, moving in different patterns

**Avatar Selection**: The client provided us with multiple 3D models that could be selected for one of the 3D tours we built.

**Character Movement**: In separate browser tabs—representing one user each—a character is moving and reflecting the correct state in their world to everyone in the same server.

**Room Teleportation**: Users can teleport to different rooms in most of the tours I developed. Upon client request, they wanted users to teleport to different rooms as soon as they reach a certain place in the world, represented by the red-colored objects.
