Users buy and customize Party Bear NFTs by equipping accessories acquired from
other NFTs and SFTs.

I was the lead developer (team of 4 devs), responsible for the initial release
with task management + delegation, doing frontend, backend, and 3D
development, and supporting the infrastructure team with task automation. This
project also featured a website with a 3D environment where owners can view
and customize their bears.

The project had a successful launch w/ good adoption!
