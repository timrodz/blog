When I visited friends back in my hometown, they introduced me to Magic: The
Gathering, a trading card game with lots of deep lore playing formats, and
fun. I really liked the game, and went to lots of local tournaments. However,
I saw one problem: hosting tournaments wa very difficult: we were playing a
format called &quot;Commander&quot; which involves 4 players paired against
each other.

My solution? To build a tournament organizing tool which let hosts add
participants, create round pairings (with complex algorithms), and easily
determine round + tournament winners. This was also an opportunity for me to
learn Elixir, a programming language I worked with at a previous role. Funnily
enough, I didn’t like Elixir at first, but now it’s my favorite programming
language!

Tie Breaker is now being used by multiple stores across Panama; I’m very
grateful for their support.
