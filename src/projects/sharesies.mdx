Sharesies is an investment platform available in NZ and AU with over
600K users. As my first startup, I learned a lot, and worked on many
key projects

Currency conversion: Exchange money between 2-3 currencies a
favorable rates with an easy UX
Auto-Invest: Automated investing by custom intervals and amount
(example: $100 per week / $1000 per month)
Australian Exchange integration: Users could now buy stock i
Australian-based companies. Learned a lot about the strict
requirements with fintech services.
