I wanted to learn how to create an extension for Visual Studio Code,
the editor I write software with. It solves a problem I have when it
comes to themes: I like using light themes during the day, and dar
themes during the night. But changing them can become a repetitive and
mundane task, which is why I automated that process with this tool.
