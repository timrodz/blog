          Born in ChitrÃ©, PanamÃ¡ ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¦ in 1995, Iâ€™m somewhat of a cross between
          millennials and Gen Zâ€™ers. That means I understand some of todayâ€™s
          memes. Since I was young, computers have been a part of my life, and
          Iâ€™m grateful I work with them dailyâ€”A dream scenario!
        </p>

          Software engineering aside, you can find me outdoors, working out
          (gym/cycling), playing games (Age Of Empires IV, Forza Horizon 5,
          Magic: The Gathering), planning the next travel destination, or
          thinking about what to learn next. Iâ€™m currently learning Portuguese,
          music theory, and content creation.

          When it comes to tools and technologies, I believe theyâ€™re there to
          help you solve problems, nothing else. I also donâ€™t have strong
          opinions about developer decisions when choosing a tech stack.
          Everything has a purpose; if it helps you solve a problem, thatâ€™s what
          matters.
